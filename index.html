	  <h2>What is Forex?</h2>
<p>Forex, also known as foreign exchange or FX, is a global market for buying and selling currencies. It is the largest financial market in the world, with a daily trading volume of over $6 trillion. In Forex, traders buy and sell different currencies in order to profit from the fluctuations in their exchange rates.</p>
<p>For example, if a trader thinks that the value of the US dollar will increase against the euro, they may buy dollars and sell euros. If the value of the dollar does indeed increase, the trader can then sell their dollars for a profit. Conversely, if the value of the dollar decreases, the trader will incur a loss.</p>
<p>Forex trading can be done through a broker or through a marketplace like a stock exchange. It is important for traders to have a good understanding of economic and political factors that can impact exchange rates, as well as technical analysis skills to help them make informed trading decisions.</p>
<h3>At Pips-2-Porsches, we believe that a well-rounded education is key to success in the Forex market. That's why our course covers both fundamental and technical analysis techniques. Fundamental analysis involves studying economic and political factors that can impact currency values, while technical analysis involves using charts and other tools to identify patterns and trends in the market.</p></h3>
	<p>Our course starts with the basics of fundamental analysis, including how to read financial statements and understand macroeconomic indicators. From there, we delve into technical analysis techniques like chart patterns, trend lines, and moving averages. By the end of the course, students will have a comprehensive understanding of both fundamental and technical analysis and how to apply them to their trading strategies.</p>
	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>What's up world, my name is Jameson and I'm a 29 years old Forex trader. I started trading in 2018 and lost a lot of money starting out. I eventually became profitable in late 2022 when I defined my trade style and mastered the psychology behind the markets. My journey began after I had a falling out with a relative of mine, leading up to me living with my girlfriend in Holland, MI. I was working a small time taxi job and hustling whatever I could get my hands on. I got tired of putting myself at risk every day so I did some research on how to make passive income. I initially found out about Forex through a friend who introduced to me IML. The information there was very good but I was turned away from their focus on the business model over the actual trading model. So throughout the next 4 years I found a mentor, connected with other motivated traders and took my skillset to the next level. In the beginning stages I was going through a lot of ups and downs. The job I had was basically on-call and I wasn't on call much. I was hustling to make extras if I wasn't making much money driving for the day. Thing were slow and eventually my girlfriend left me so I ended up staying with a friend and his misses, including their new born child. That only lasted so long and I found myself couch surfing. After a year and some months I finally ended up back in Texas where I was origianlly before I relocated to Michigan. My trading was on and off due to insufficient profits to take care of my bills and major expenses. So having quit multiple jobs, moving city to city, and no sense of real stability I was finally able to manage my time and conquer the skill of scalping the markets for profit. Late 2022 I grew my account to $3200+ within 2 days, and from that moment I knew I was locked in. So coming into 2023, I have dedicated my time to creating content for those who have looked for a way out of their struggle and felt the hole only getting deeper.</p>
	<p>"I believe that with the right education and guidance, anyone can achieve financial freedom through trading. That's why I created Pips-2-Porsches - to provide a comprehensive and accessible course for aspiring traders. I look forward to sharing my knowledge and experience with you and helping you achieve your financial goals."</p>
