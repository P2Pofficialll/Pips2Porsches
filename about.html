    <h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>What's up world, my name is Jameson and I'm a 29 years old Forex trader. I started trading in 2018 and lost a lot of money starting out. I eventually became profitable in late 2022 when I defined my trade style and mastered the psychology behind the markets. My journey began in late 2018 when I was living in Holland, MI. I had a few jobs but they weren't paying much so I eventually quit and started hustling. I was staying with my cousin for a while but we had a falling out so fortunately I was able to stay with a close friend and his misses, including their new born child. That only lasted so long because I ended up quitting my jobs and I ended up moving in with my girlfriend of a couple days. During the time of our relationshp I was fortunate to get a cash job driving for a local taxi. We were together for about 6months but things began to wither out, I left and moved in with some friends I worked with. During my stay with them I ended up getting fired from the job due to "low productivity".  Finally after a year and some months I ended up back in Texas where I was origianlly before Michigan. My trading was on and off due to me being broke and having insufficient profit to take care of my bills and major expenses. So having quit multiple jobs, moving city to city, and no sense of real stability I was finally able to manage some time and master the skill of scalping the markets for profits. Late 2022, sometime in December,  I was able to take my account to $3200+ within 2 days, from that moment I knew I was locked in. So coming into 2023 with everything I've been through I decided that I would dedicate my time to teaching individuals who experienced harships like myself how to trade Forex and potentially make a change for the better.</p>
	<p>"I believe that with the right education and guidance, anyone can achieve financial freedom through trading. That's why I created Pips-2-Porsches - to provide a comprehensive and accessible course for aspiring traders. I look forward to sharing my knowledge and experience with you and helping you achieve your financial goals."</p>
